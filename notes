    Main idea
    - to search for the bugs we need to have a constant (in this case bug ID) to recall the details we want.
    - we can use arrays to manage all the bug fields
    - a single file per bug
    - the name of the file needs to reflect the BugID for the purpose of searching bugs

    Other notes
    - UI mut be last thing
