    Main idea
    - to search for the bugs we need to have a constant (in this case bug ID) to recall the details we want.
    - a single array per entry
    - another array will be to collect all the other arrays where the first entry is the bug ID

    As we probably need to write on files we could do the following:
    - we can write one file per bug - the name of the file needs to reflect the BugID for search purpose
